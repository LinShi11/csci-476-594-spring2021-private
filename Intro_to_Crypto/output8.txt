IN THE PAST cEW YEARS UNIVERSITIES LIKE EVERYONE ELSE HAVE sECOME INCREASINGLY
AWARE Oc ONLINE THREATS CAMPUSES HAVE SEEN THEIR PAYROLL SYSTEMS COMPROMISED sY
 CRIMINALS WHO STEAL cACULTY AND STAcc PASSWORDS OcTEN sY MEANS Oc PHISHING EMAILS

SEVERAL HAVE sEEN TARGETED sY RANSOMWARE ATTACKS INCLUDING dUST IN THE PAST MONTH
REGIS UNIVERSITY AND STEVENS INSTITUTE Oc TECHNOLOGY SOME HAVE SEEN EMAIL ACCOUNTS
COMPROMISED AND USED TO SEND OUT THOSE PHISHING MESSAGES sECAUSE EMAILS

 DOES THE RISK Oc SPIES OR CRIMINALS USING COMPROMISED SERVERS ON US CAMPUSES
AS HOP POINTS TO ROUT AN ATTACK DIRECTED AT ANOTHER TARGET LIKE A GOVERNMENT
AGENCY OR PRIVATE COMPANY

c THAT cIREWALL WERE AÂ PERSON SO ITS VERY MUCH TO THEIR CREDIT THAT SO MANY SCHOOLS
