3. Through lab zero, I have learned and remembered some ideas about VirtualBox, markdown, and GitHub.  <br>
First, VMs depend on the GPU for its performance; thus, if the VM is slow at responding, the GPU assigned to the VM must be increased. (This was done after a solid time of waiting). <br>
Second, in order to properly run a VirtualBox, one must go into the BIOS while restarting the computer and enable the Virtualization Technology (This might not be the exact name of it).  <br>
Third, if the GitHub version is too low, it will fail to authenticate and cause some weird errors. Therefore, I have learned to update Git Bash, which could be done with git update-git-for-windows.<br>
Lastly, I have learned how to insert images into GitHub READMEs, which is easier than I expected.
